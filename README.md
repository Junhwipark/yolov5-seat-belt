# Seatbelt Detection Model  
*Project for Nvidia AI Specialist Certification*

## 1. Opening Background Information  
Traffic accidents are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and the lack of seatbelt usage significantly increases the severity of injuries during collisions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), wearing seatbelts reduces the risk of death by approximately 50% in the event of an accident. Despite its importance, many drivers neglect or forget to wear seatbelts.  

As vehicle technologies evolve toward autonomy and smart functionality, there remains a pressing need to address fundamental safety measures. Developing an AI-powered system to detect seatbelt usage in real time can bridge this gap, ensuring enhanced safety for all vehicle occupants.

## 2. General Description of the Current Project  
This project focuses on designing a deep learning-based model to detect seatbelt usage in real time. Using footage from in-vehicle cameras, the system analyzes whether passengers are correctly wearing seatbelts and triggers alerts when non-compliance is detected.  

### **Key Development Stages:**  
1. **Data Collection and Annotation:**  
   - Collect diverse datasets reflecting real-world conditions (e.g., variations in lighting, passenger positions, and clothing styles).  

2. **Model Design and Training:**  
   - Utilize advanced object detection and action recognition frameworks (e.g., YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN).  
   - Train the model to achieve high accuracy in detecting seatbelt usage.  

3. **System Integration:**  
   - Deploy the model in an edge-computing environment.  
   - Integrate with vehicle alert systems for real-time feedback.
